The move is done at Load before the ScriptManager register the child scripts for everything to work correctly. This methods suits me well and no controls ever broke in my child element. I used ajax calendar, watermark, componentart calendar, and componentart editor. For a yet unknow reason the RTE is the only control that break when including it my child element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScripts crash when trying to acess object exactly at line 82 in RTEStarup.js : RteJustifyLeft.AddRelatedButton(RteJustifyRight);<br>\r\nRteJustifyLeft is undefined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hints on this would be appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThx \r\n",
