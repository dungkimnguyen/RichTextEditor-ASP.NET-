In some tabs, I want to display comments in a RTE which can be stored after.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;For the moment, I use an iFrame for each tab ans in the iframes the component doesn't display at all... When I refresh the frame, all is fine. Could someone tell me if he has any idea of what happens and how ot solve it??</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Julien.</p>",
