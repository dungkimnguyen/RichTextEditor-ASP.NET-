When I put the control in a simple master page, I don't have any problems with the dropdown lists. If you try testing with a simple master page then add parts of your master page that's causing the trouble piece by piece, you might be able to track down what is specifically causing the dropdown lists to appear outside the RTE. If you do find out, let us know and we'll see what we can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nRob<br>\r\n<div style=\"border-style:dotted none;border-color:rgb(170, 170, 170) -moz-use-text-color;border-width:0.1em medium;margin:1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding:0.2em;font-style:italic\"><br>\r\nashok_cmohan wrote:<br>\r\nhi&nbsp; Yorkrj , <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthanks for your suggestion and solutions , i have done the same as what you have told , now i have another issue , in which when i put the rte inside a page in which page has been inherited by a master page , every thing is working fine , but when i click the font or font size drop down , <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><strong>the drop down list does not appears below it , it appears out of&nbsp; the rte</strong></em></span> , please suggest your solution on this issue . <br>\r\nthanks for your patience on reading this , <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthanks , <br>\r\nashok.c<br>\r\n<div style=\"border-style:dotted none;border-color:rgb(170, 170, 170) -moz-use-text-color;border-width:0.1em medium;margin:1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding:0.2em;font-style:italic\"><br>\r\nyorkrj wrote:<br>\r\nHi Ashok,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm having the same problems with the toolbar buttons.
