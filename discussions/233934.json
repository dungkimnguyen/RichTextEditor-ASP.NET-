Thinking it might be a framework versioning issue, I made sure ot try loading the project as version 2 and compiling accordingly.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this behaviour, or does anyone\r\n have a solution?&nbsp; I've been trying to sort this out for over a day now and can't find what's wrong.</p>\r\n",
