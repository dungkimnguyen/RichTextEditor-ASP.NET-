The primary developer and myself are not actively updating the control. Do note that there are potential XSS security vulnerabilities with this\r\n control unless you validate and/or filter any form inputs from it on the server. It would take a lot of work to get this where it needs to be.</p>\r\n<p>There are other great WYSIWYG web editors for ASP.NET available. One alternative to look at is the HTMLEditor that is a part of recent versions of the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit which can be found here on CodePlex.</p>\r\n<p>All that being said, it was a lot of fun contributing to this control and it remains an interesting collection of code to take a look at and learn from.</p>\r\n",
