    "Html": "\r\nHello,<br />  I do not have much experience with firefox, but the way you describe the problem makes me think that it could be a Page Request Validation issue.  A quick way to test this is to set the page validation property to false by doing the following:  &lt;%@ Page <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/rte/Wiki/View.aspx?title=...%20some%20other%20stuff%20...\">... some other stuff ...</a> ValidateRequest=\"false\" %&gt;  .  If this doesn't do the trick, perhaps someone else can offer advice.<br />",
