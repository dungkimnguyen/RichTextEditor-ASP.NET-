I've tried several methods in addition, but I think my problem is that no matter what I do, I get InitRte(); as the last entry in my &lt;script&gt; section.  I've looked through the code of the RTE to comment out the focus call, but there are many calls to focus and I'm not sure which one to comment out.  Can you tell me which one to comment out?  I'm guessing it's the call to this.GetWindow().focus() in RichTextEditor.prototype.Focus = function()?<br />",

I have modified this area so much it is difficult to remember exactly what happens where in the original version.  But you are definetely on the right track.<br />",
