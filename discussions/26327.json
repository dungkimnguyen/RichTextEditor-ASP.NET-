If you are using VS 2008 you could try clicking and dragging the RichTextEditor folder from the os File Explorer to the root project directory in Visual Studios solution explorer... this would probably work, but I haven't tried.  In 2005 you'd probably have to do the right mouse click on the project root and use add existing.<br />",
