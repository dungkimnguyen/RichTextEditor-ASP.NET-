On the form's submission, I am attempting to access the contents using Request.Form(&quot;Main$editor&quot;). This only returns the contents of the file initially loaded; any changes made are not represented. If I switch to HTML view prior to submission, however, the changes do show up. I have tried adding&nbsp;&quot;CopyText();return true;&quot; to the button's OnClientClick event, but this seems to make no difference.</p>",
