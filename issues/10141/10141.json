    "Description": "Hi, I am using the RichTextEditor on a page with an ascx header control, on the header then are asp link buttons. When I click one of the link buttons I get the \"potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client\" error because the text in the RichTextEditor contains html tags (depending on what I put in the editor). I know that the text needs to be encoded before the page is posted back but am not sure how to go about this. I don't want to turn page validation off for security reasons.\n \nSomebody else created this page but they have now left the company so I am a bit frustrated as I don't think this page has ever worked properly.\n \nThis is my link button on the ascx control - \n<asp:LinkButton ID=\"lnkBtnAdminMenuUserAdmin\" runat=\"server\" PostBackUrl=\"~/Secure/Users.aspx\" Text=\"User Administration\" CssClass=\"MenuLinkButton\" ForeColor=\"white\" Width=\"150px\"></asp:LinkButton>\n \nThis is the editor declaration on the main page -\n<%@ Register Assembly=\"RichTextEditor\" Namespace=\"AjaxControls\" TagPrefix=\"cc1\" %>\n<cc1:RichTextEditor ID=\"RTF\" runat=\"server\"  />\n \nAny help would be appreciated.",
