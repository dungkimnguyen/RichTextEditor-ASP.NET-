      "Message": "I had the same issue and went ahead and made my own modifycation. That turns out to be a bit difficult because the tabstrip is create during 'EnsureChildControls', this function is called on almost every get/set attribute value. Which means the sequence of attributes is getting to be important (unless you change the whole creation/attribute logic).\r\n\r\nI did it simplistic solution:\r\n        public Boolean ShowTabStrip\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                object o = ViewState[\"ShowTabStrip\"];\r\n                return (o == null) ? true : (Boolean)o;\r\n            }\r\n            set\r\n            {\r\n                ViewState[\"ShowTabStrip\"] = value;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nAnd put an if around the adding of the tapstrip in 'CreateChildControls'\r\n\r\nThen add 'ShowTabStrip=\"false\"' as the first attribute, works good enough for me, ideally the 'CreateChildControls' should be done as late as possible.",
